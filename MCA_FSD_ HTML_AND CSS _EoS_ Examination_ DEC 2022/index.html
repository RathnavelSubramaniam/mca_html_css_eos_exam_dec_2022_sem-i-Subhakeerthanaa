  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. It was first announced in July 2013 as a 
    budget smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces 
     upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones.Redmi phones use the Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. Models are divided into the entry-level
      Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K. In addition, the unrelated  Mi A Android One series is also positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices,despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup. The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive components and thus have lower prices while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second 
    quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 4% of smartphone shipment rankings in China.[2] Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.[2]
    Redmi is set to bring another new smartphone lineup in the budget segment in India very soon. The company has teased the new Redmi A1 smartphone which is likely to focus on the entry-level segment.
   Redmi already has the regular Redmi 10a series in the same price range, but it seems the brand will give the Redmi A1 a different twist by offering it a stock Android experience</p>
