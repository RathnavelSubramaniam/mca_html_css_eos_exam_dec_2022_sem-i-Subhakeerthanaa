<p>We continue to work to enhance shareholder value alongside our efforts to strengthen competitiveness of our products and
  businesses. We utilized 50% of the free cash flow as the shareholder return pool for 2018 to 2020 as part of our
  shareholder return policy for 2018 to 2020 and will pay annual, regular dividends of KRW 9.6 trillion and a special cash
  dividend of KRW 10.7 trillion will be paid out at the same time as the 2020 end-year, regular dividend. The shareholder
  return policy for 2021 to 2023 was announced in January 2021. For this term, we kept the shareholder return pool at 50%
  of the free cash flow, but increased the annual, regular dividend to KRW 9.8 trillion. Any remaining portion of the 50% of
  the free cash flow will be paid out to shareholders. </p>
  <p>
    Goodwill impairment reviews are performed annually, and the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined
based on value-in-use calculations, etc. These calculations generally use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets
approved by management covering a five-year period, unless it is reasonable to use long-term financial budgets longer than five
years in new technology business. Perpetual cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a constant growth rate
assumption. The growth rate applied was capped at the long-term average growth rate.

    Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but does not have control, generally investees of which
from 20% to 50% voting shares are owned by the Company. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, after initially being recognized at cost. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its associates are
eliminated to the extent of the Company.
